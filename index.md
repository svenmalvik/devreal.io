How are Norwegian companies like Vipps, SATS, Orkla, Statsbygg, and DNV GL using Azure API Management?

This event is about real experiences and learnings. I want to know what other developers think about this service, and what questions and answers they might have.

This event is split into 3 sections. In the first section the speakers will briefly tell about their experiences with APIM. In the second section we have Miao Jiang from Microsoft who will tell about what they are doing in the product team to help and support us developers. In the third section we’ll have a real tech conversation where we will get a lot of valuable insights.

Thanks so much to the speakers for participating. It really means a lot to many developers that haven’t used Azure API Management yet. I also want to send a special thanks to Miao Jiang from Microsoft which I had the pleasure to be on stage with at MS Build 2019 where we talked about Azure API Management.

This episodes guests are all from well-known Norwegian companies that uses Azure API Management in production. What I will ask them is how they use the service, and what their use cases are. Most interesting though is to talk about their experiences and what do they want to achieve with API Management.
