How are organizations like Vipps, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Aker Solutions establishing a diverse and inclusive workplace? What initiatives are they driving and how can we all work together to create a positive impact?

This event is about real experiences. We want to know why this topic matters so much to employees, students and companies.

This event is split into 2 sections. In the first section the speakers will tell about their experiences. In the second section we’ll have a real conversation where we will get a lot of valuable insights.

Thanks so much to the speakers for participating. It really means a lot to many that want to know more about the topic. I also want to send a special thanks to Ellie King who will moderate this event.

This episodes guests are from well-known companies. In addition we have a student with us which will tell about what she expects from life.
