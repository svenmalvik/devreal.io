What experiences do they have, and what do they think about the service? I wanted to know more, so I organized an event with developers that use this service and have gained great experience. In addition to that, I invited the Global Black Belt and Technical Specialist Gustav Kaleta to answer questions, but also to tell us about some cool and new features.

This event is split into 3 sections. In the first section the speakers will briefly tell about their experiences with AKS and insights that are most valuable to them. In the second section, Gustav Kaleta from Microsoft will tell about how they help and support us developers. In the third section we will have a short tech conversation where we will discuss topics and answer questions coming from the audience and the moderator.

Thanks so much to the speakers for participating. It really means a lot to many that want to know more about AKS. I also want to send a special thanks to Gustav Kaleta from Microsoft who will help us to get the most out of this event.
